Bundled plugins
===============

Molecule is shipped with plugins for the following tools:

- C++ (clang and CMake)
- Eslint
- Flowtype
- Gulp
- Jest
- NPM
- React Native
- Testcafe
- A regular shell

**Note:** For now, Molecule is capable of running only the bundled plugins.
In the near future, we will integrate an API allowing plugin developers to
easily integrate their plugins to Molecule.

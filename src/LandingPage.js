                      Molecule provides you a powerful configuration system, we give you the control of where and how things
                      are running. Select remote development to execute the tools of your choice on another machine or VM.
                      Each configuration will create an execution plan linked to a a button, allowing reuse of one click exec.

                      The centralized tooling allows centralized diagnostics. Keep tracks of what happens during development : errors, warnings,
                      infos and successes, grouped by tasks. Navigate throughout them quickly with the organized mode. We also provide you
                      the classical logging output, with a searchbar to find informations quickly. It's up to you, as always.
